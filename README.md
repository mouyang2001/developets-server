# About

Developets is a DEVS â€“ Developers Society 48 Hour Hackathon project.

On Developets, dev teams can collectively own a virtual pet that's affected by the project quality based on your team's code quality. When a new person joins the team, they will learn its code standards quickly as the seniors will be sentimental about the team pet and help the junior not to kill it.

Developets won 1st place, a Centrality.ai special prize and was also awarded best technical implementation.

Side Note: This repo was split from the original repo: https://github.com/Ray-F/developets to be more compatible for heroku hosting.
